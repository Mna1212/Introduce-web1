    <h1>introduce myself</h1>
    <p1>Hello</p1>
    <p2>I am <mark>Muhammad Nur Azis</mark>,and 
        I am thrilled to introduce myself as a new student 
        at Chaoyang University,where I am embarking on my 
        academic journey in the field of Management Information.
        Originally from Indonesia,I am enthusiastic about the 
        prospects of learning and growing within this dynamic 
        academic community while immersing myself in a new culture.
        My choice to study Management Information is deeply rooted 
        in my passion for the fusion of technology and business.
        I believe that this program will equip me with the 
        necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the fast paced 
        world of information management,enabling me to contribute 
        to innovative solutions that bridge the gap between 
        technology and effective business operations.Having 
        completed my undergraduate studies in computer science,
        I have gained a solid foundation in programming,
        data analysis,and software development.</p2>

        <p>I am excited to build upon this knowledge and expand 
        my expertise in the context of management information 
        systems.
        Beyond my academic pursuits,I am an adventurous 
        explorer with a strong desire to understand and appreciate 
        different cultures.Coming to Taiwan presents an exciting 
        opportunity for me to experience a new way of life,taste 
        diverse cuisines,and meet people from all walks of life.
        I look forward to making meaningful connections with 
        fellow students and dedicated professors.I am confident 
        that this cross cultural exposure will not only enrich 
        my personal growth but also provide a unique perspective 
        that I can apply to my studies in Management Information.
        In conclusion,my journey as a Management Information student at Chaoyang University promises 
        to be an enriching and transformative experience.
        am excited to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead,and I am eager to 
        make the most of my time here,both academically and personally.My goal is to not only excel 
        in my studies but also to contribute positively to the academic and social fabric of this 
        esteemed institution.</p>
